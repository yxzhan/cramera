"""
Bundles a live world's *current* model into a throwaway scene.

Serializes the world object the bridge is attached to — the robot subtree as one
model, everything else as the environment model — through the same
:class:`~cramera.onboard.world_to_urdf.UrdfDocument` serializer every recorded scene
goes through. Whatever a demo built its world from, and however it built it, is what
the viewer shows; no model source tracking or manual onboarding is involved.

A build is idempotent: while the world model is unchanged, the existing bundle is left
untouched — a viewer may be downloading its files at any moment, and deleting them
mid-flight breaks the page that requested the rebuild in the first place.
