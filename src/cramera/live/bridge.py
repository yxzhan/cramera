"""
The live-viz bridge state: what a running demo publishes to the viewer.

This module is free of HTTP — it holds the :class:`Bridge` singleton whose snapshot
methods run on the *simulation* thread (driven by the world's own callbacks and the
plan callbacks of :mod:`cramera.live.visualization`) and whose ``get_*`` accessors
hand finished, plain-dict snapshots to the HTTP layer.

Node status is where the plan and the statechart differ: coraplex only performs the plan
root (``Plan.perform`` → ``root.perform``); ``ActionNode.notify`` expands its children
but never performs them, so every inner ``PlanNode`` keeps status ``CREATED`` for the
whole run. The real per-step progress arrives through the plan callbacks, which report
each motion node's start and end; those statuses are propagated up the plan tree and
flagged ``derived``.
