"""
Writing a finalized live recording to disk as a replayable scene bundle.

Produces exactly the ``scene.json``/``trajectory.json``/``meshes/`` shape an onboarded
scene is recorded into (see :meth:`cramera.onboard.demo.SceneBuilder.build`), so the
frontend's existing trajectory playback needs no changes to replay a recording — only
the scene name differs. Always writes under
:func:`cramera.paths.local_scenes_directory`, never a shared scenes root: a recording is
a local capture until the user explicitly saves it, and saving must never touch a git-
tracked scenes checkout.
