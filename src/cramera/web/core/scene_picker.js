/* ============================================================================
 * core/scene_picker.js — resolves the header's robot/environment dropdowns
 * to one onboarded scene bundle.
 *
 * There is no independent robot/environment mixing: each onboarded scene is a
 * fixed (robot, environment) recording. This module only looks up, among the
 * scenes actually onboarded, which one matches a chosen (robot, environment)
 * pair — so the two dropdowns in robot_scene/panel.js look independent while
 * only ever landing on a combination that was actually recorded.
 *
 * `scenes` is `scenes/index.json`'s `scenes` array: entries shaped like
 * {name, robot, environment}, where `environment` is null for a bench-only
 * scene (no environment model, e.g. a robot recorded alone on a bench).
