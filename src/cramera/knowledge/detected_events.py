"""
What a run's detectors saw, as something a query can range over.

A detector produces events about bodies of the running world; a question is asked about
them in the same language as everything else, so each event is flattened to the names
and the moment a question actually asks for.

Only that flattened form lives here, and nothing of the detectors themselves: this
module is read by the recorded viewer, which is meant to serve without the detectors'
own package -- and without the ROS overlay that one needs.
