"""
The live publisher: what a running CRAM world offers the viewer.

The simulation thread reports the world's state and model changes, the plan's progress
and every motion tick; each component takes its snapshot then, the world's state only
once it is settled (see :mod:`cramera_bridge.live.snapshot_pacing`). HTTP threads only
read those snapshots, and queue the changes a person makes, which are written on the
thread that owns the world.
